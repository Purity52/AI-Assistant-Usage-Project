#### AI Assistant Usage in Student Life
-This project analyzes how students use AI assistants in their daily academic life. The dataset provides synthetic records of session lengths, task types, and usage behavior, offering insights into how AI tools support student learning.

#### Dataset Information
- Key columns include:
- SessionLengthMin - Duration of AI assistant sessions (in minutes).
- TaskType  Type of task completed (e.g., Writing, Studying, Homework, Coding, Brainstorming, Research Help).
- Other attributes - Student demographics and usage context.

#### Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas - Data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn - Data visualization
- Jupyter Notebook / Kaggle - Interactive analysis

#### Objectives
- Explore session length distribution to understand typical usage time.
- Identify the most common academic tasks supported by AI assistants.
- Compare frequency of usage across different tasks.
- Highlight overall patterns in AI usage among students.

#### Key Insights
- Most sessions last 0–20 minutes, showing that students prefer short, focused interactions.
- Writing is the most common AI-assisted task, followed by Studying and Homework support.
- Coding, Brainstorming, and Research Help occur less frequently but show AI’s versatility.
- Overall, AI assistants are used as on-demand academic helpers rather than for extended continuous sessions.
